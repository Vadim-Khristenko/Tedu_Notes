# About this site {id: "about"}

This site is more than a collection of notes.  
It's an open notebook where we record together what helps to understand programming more deeply: algorithms, data structures, architectural patterns — and even those "aha!" moments that don't fit into textbooks.

Everything here is free, open, and alive.  
Notes can be read online, copied, improved, and expanded.  
Every file is a Markdown document in the GitHub repository, and any of you can become a co-author.

We believe that learning should not be expensive, boring, or closed.  
It should be accessible, clear — and even a little cozy.  
That's why this site exists: so you can learn not alone, but alongside others who are also finding their way through the complexities of code.

# Welcome, traveler! {id: "intro"}

It all started simply: a few lines in a notebook, a random Gist on GitHub, a note in the margins of a textbook.  
I was just trying to hold on to what felt important.

Over time those "holdings" began to grow.  
They stopped being only mine — friends, colleagues, even strangers on the internet started using them.  
And then I realized: **these are no longer just notes. They are knowledge I want to pass on.**

So a repository of Markdown notes was born.  
And later — a website.  
Not for the sake of a checkbox, but so that anyone seeking understanding can find it easily, beautifully, and without noise.

Here we are. You read, I share. And maybe, somewhere in that exchange, something bigger is born.

## :thinking: What's the difference between the notes and the site? {id: "difference"}

Honestly — almost none.  
**Notes** are plain text in Markdown. They live in an [open GitHub repository](https://github.com/Vadim-Khristenko/Tedu_Notes) and anyone can read, copy, or improve them.

The **site** is their "home."  
Here they gain structure, search, easy navigation, and a bit of polish: minimalist design, pleasant fonts, silence instead of ads.  
It's like taking a book off the shelf — only the book is already open to the right page.

## 🛠️ Why do I do this? {id: "why"}

You could say: "For myself."  
And that's true — writing notes helps me learn deeper, think clearer, and see connections between topics.

But more honestly: **I do this for all of us.**  
For those studying late at night.  
For those who need a "simple explanation."  
For those who worry they "can't keep up" in programming.

I believe good knowledge shouldn't be locked behind paid courses or lost among hundreds of videos.  
It should be **clear, free, and accessible** — like air.

And yes, I just like coding. And sharing.  
It's my way of saying to the world: *"Here, take this. Maybe it'll help."*

## 📚 What will you find here? {id: "contents"}

The main content right now is notes from [algocourse.ru](https://algocourse.ru) — a course that became a real pillar in my study of algorithms.

But this is just the beginning.  
Plans include expanding: adding notes on architecture, systems programming, mathematics, and simply reflections on how to learn without burning out.

Stay tuned. Who knows — maybe the next note will be written by you?
